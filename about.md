# About Protobox

Protobox is a layer on top of [vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) and a [web GUI](http://getprotobox.com) to setup virtual machines for web development. A single [YAML document](https://github.com/protobox/protobox/blob/master/data/config/common.yml-dist) controls everything that is installed on the virtual machine. You can install [popular languages](https://github.com/protobox/protobox#languages), [software](https://github.com/protobox/protobox#modules), and even [popular web applications](https://github.com/protobox/protobox#applications) or your [own private GIT repositories](https://github.com/protobox/protobox#applications) with a simple on/off toggle in YAML.
